For most, that means getting obliterated at 9 a.m. and passing out before the concert even starts. But we at NBN know that many of you ambitious future world leaders have greater aspirations &#8212; which is why we've returned for the second edition of Dillo Bingo! This game is not for the faint of heart, but for those who truly want to get the most out of their Dillo Day experience. Remember, Dillo is a marathon, not a sprint. But if you sprint through it, you'll finish before everyone else.</p>";
