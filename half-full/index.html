		<div class="subhead">
			<p>EXPERTS SAY:</p>
		</div>

		<div class="item group">
			<p>“We always wanted a high yield, because the higher the yield, the greater draw the school has. It gives you higher ranking, it gives you more interest with donors and athletes and increases the reputation of the institution.”<br>
			<span class="source">- <b>Drusilla Blackman</b>, former dean of admissions, Columbia</span>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="item group">
			<p>“During early decision, certain preferences are given to legacies, athletes or kids whose parents are tied to the university."<br><span class="source">- <b>Sung Lee</b>, co-founder at Solomon Admissions Consulting</span>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="item group">
			<p>“I think a lot of students are looking critically at applying early. Also, they may see ED as attractive because it alleviates stress early on.”<br><span class="source" style="border:none">- <b>Bari Norman</b>, college consultant at Expert Admissions</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="item">
			<p>“The push to ED has an impact on the senior year. There’s stress on the child to fall in love with the school without taking the time to really figure out if they like every aspect of it or not.”<br><span class="source">- <b>Maria Steiner</b>, associate director of college counseling, Hawken School (Ohio)</span>
			</p>
